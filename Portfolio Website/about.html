					<h2><span>Who Am I</span></h2>
					<p>My name is Alexander Caza. I am a Grade 11 student at Earl Marriott in Surrey, British Columbia currently taking <b>Mr. Dawson's Programming Level 2</b> class. I was born in Canada on September 3rd, 2005. Both my parents have engineering degrees and MBAs. I went to Ã‰cole Laronde, which is a French Immersion elementary school. I would describe myself as a top student. I had a 4.0 GPA in Grade 11 and work hard in all my classes.</p>
					<h2><span>My Hobbies</span></h2>
					<p id="nopaddingbottom">Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with friends online, programming and working out. I also enjoy reading. My favourite genres of books are Science Fiction and Military Fiction. My 5 favourite books of all time are probably:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>The Hunger Games</b> by Suzanne Collins</li>
						<li><b>The Exile Empire</b> by Joshua Done</li>
						<li><b>The Hunt for Red October</b> by Tom Clancy</li>
						<li><b>Zombie Fallout</b> by Mark Tufo</li>
						<li><b>Ender's Game</b> by Orson Scott Card</li>
					</ol>
					<p>I am also currently a volunteer Developer, Project Manager and Staff Manager for a Minecraft server called Advancius which averages about 150 concurrent players during the day. I set up plugins, plan, develop and implement projects, conduct interviews and staff orientations and help decide who gets promoted or demoted. I am currently working towards earning my <a href="https://www.dukeofed.org/">Duke Of Edinburgh Bronze Award</a>. I am also currently working on enlisting in the Canadian Army Reserves as an <a href="https://forces.ca/en/career/infanteer/">Infanteer</a> at the Royal Westminster Regiment in New Westminster. This summer, I am hoping to custom code and launch a finance blog.

					<h2><span>My Future</span></h2>
					<p id="nopaddingbottom">Although I am only at the end of Grade 11, I think I have a fairly good idea of what I want to do in life. I hope to be admitted to the University of Waterloo to Waterloo to study Computer Science. If I don't get into the University of Waterloo, I will probably attend either the University of British Columbia or the University of Toronto. No matter what university I go, I will try to get into the Co-op program there. I will try to get Co-op placements at FAANGM companies. Once I graduate, I will try to join a big tech company as a software engineer. Hopeful, I will have gotten an internship at one of the them, which will make me more likely to to be able to get a job at one of them. I hope to have my employer sponsor me for a green card so that I can move to the United States and become a citizen. I will try to save aggressive and make a large amount of money working as a software engineer. If I end up staying in Canada, I will likely apply to become an <a href="https://forces.ca/en/career/intelligence-officer/">Intelligence Officer</a> in the Canadian Army Reserves.</p>
