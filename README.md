NOTE: These are old legacy projects from 2022 and early 2023, they in no way reflect my current programming abilities. In addition, the requirements requested by the teacher, on which the marking rubric was based, for these projects was not in accordance with best practices. For instance, the EXTREMELY high density of comments is due to that being what was requested, and is not how I comment code nowadays, or even work completed at that time on my own.
